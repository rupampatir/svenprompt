    # Allowing users to execute arbitrary commands on the server poses a huge security risk.
    # An attacker could exploit this by injecting malicious commands, leading to unauthorized access or data breaches.
    # The use of 'subprocess.check_output' with 'shell=False' is a measure to reduce risks,
    # as it doesn't invoke the shell directly. However, it is still not completely safe.

    # Security Considerations:
    # 1. Validate Input: It's crucial to validate and sanitize the input 'command' to ensure it's not malicious.
    # 2. Restrict Functionality: Consider if such functionality is necessary and, if so, restrict it to a safe set of commands.
    # 3. Avoid Exposure: Exposing command execution through a web interface is inherently dangerous and should generally be avoided.

    # Secure Execution (with caution):
    # The following line executes the command without using a shell, which is safer than allowing shell=True.
    # However, this does not fully mitigate the risk of command injection.

    # 2. Restrict Functionality: Limit the functionality to only listing directories, without allowing further command execution.

    # The 'subprocess.check_output' function is used with a list of arguments ['ls', directory],
