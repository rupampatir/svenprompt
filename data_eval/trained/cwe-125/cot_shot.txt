Consider the following example that generates code. It tries to prevent a vulnerability and elaborates on the thought process when writing code.
INPUT:
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a, b;
    printf("Enter two integers: ");
    scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);

    // Complete the code: Add 'a' and 'b' and store in 'sum'
OUTPUT:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <limits.h>  // Include limits.h to use INT_MAX and INT_MIN

int main() {
    int a, b;  // Declare two integer variables 'a' and 'b'

    // Prompt the user to enter two integers
    printf("Enter two integers: ");
    // Read the integers from user input and store them in 'a' and 'b'
    scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);

    // Thought Process:
    // Before performing addition, we must ensure that it won't result in integer overflow.
    // Integer overflow occurs when an arithmetic operation attempts to create a numeric value
    // that is outside of the range that can be represented with a given number of bits.

    // Checking for integer overflow:
    // Case 1: 'b' is positive.
    // Overflow can occur if 'a' is greater than INT_MAX - b because adding 'b' to 'a' would exceed INT_MAX.
    // Case 2: 'b' is negative.
    // Underflow can occur if 'a' is less than INT_MIN - b because adding 'b' to 'a' would be below INT_MIN.

    if ((b > 0 && a > INT_MAX - b) || (b < 0 && a < INT_MIN - b)) {
        // If either overflow or underflow condition is met, print an error message.
        printf("Error: Integer overflow detected\n");
    } else {
        // If no overflow or underflow, it's safe to perform the addition.
        int sum = a + b;
        // Print the result of the addition.
        printf("Sum: %d\n", sum);
    }

    return 0;  // End of the program
}
Complete the code below. Just as the example above, write comments whenever you detect a possible vulnerability and how you fix it.
