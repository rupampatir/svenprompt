    // Thought Process:
    // Our goal is to calculate the total cost without causing an integer overflow.
    // Integer overflow occurs when an arithmetic operation produces a result that exceeds the maximum value of the data type.

    // To prevent integer overflow when multiplying two integers, we check if the result would exceed INT_MAX.
    // The condition for overflow in multiplication is:
    // If the first number is greater than the maximum possible value divided by the second number.

    // Checking for overflow in this specific case:
    // If the price per item is greater than zero, we need to check if multiplying it by the number of items would exceed INT_MAX.
